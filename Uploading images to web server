# The Python requests module is used to send the file contents to the [linux-instance-IP-Address] / upload URL  that is handles the fruit catalog.
# In the home directory, a script takes jpeg images from the supplier-data/images directory to upload to the running fruit catalog web server is required.
# the script is called supplier_image_upload.py:


#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, sys
import requests

url = "http://[linux-instance-IP-Address] / upload URL "
path = "/home/directory/supplier-data/images/"

images = os.listdir(path)

for image in images:
  if image.endswith(".jpeg"):
    with open(path + image, 'rb') as opened:
      r = requests.post(url, files={'file': opened})
